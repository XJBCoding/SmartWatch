# SmartWatch
In this lab, we make our smartwatch application (more specifically the ESP8266) into a server that will take requests from a smartphone app through HTTP. More specifically, the smartphone app will send commands or requests to the smartwatch server, and the smartwatch will execute these commands. This app is based on google speech API demo.
